# Fake-News-Detection

In today's digital age, the proliferation of fake news has become a significant concern, influencing public opinion, sowing discord, and sometimes leading to real-world consequences. Detecting and mitigating the spread of false information is a crucial task for researchers, technologists, and policymakers. Among the various techniques employed for fake news detection, logistic regression stands out as a powerful and interpretable machine learning algorithm.

Logistic regression, a statistical method used for binary classification, is well-suited for distinguishing between true and false news articles. By analyzing the relationship between a set of input features—such as text-based characteristics, metadata, and user interactions—and the likelihood of a news article being fake, logistic regression can effectively classify news as either true or fake.

The simplicity and efficiency of logistic regression make it a popular choice for this task. It provides probabilistic outputs, which can be valuable for understanding the confidence level of the predictions. Moreover, logistic regression's interpretability allows us to gain insights into which features are most indicative of fake news, aiding in the development of more robust detection systems.

In this context, our exploration will delve into the application of logistic regression for fake news detection. We will examine the underlying principles of the algorithm, the process of feature extraction and selection, and the model's performance on a dataset of news articles. Through this approach, we aim to demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of logistic regression in combating the challenge of fake news.
